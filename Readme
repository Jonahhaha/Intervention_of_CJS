# The whole process: 
fit/replicate GRASP-FCI model
(2) Bootstrap stability analysis
(3) Estimate causal effect
(4) simulate intervention
(5) Predictive modeling with current set of variables
(6) Various sensitivity analysis and analysis including additional variables.

The final papar about this topic
The Code for writing the bootstrap
The code for the result of the GRASPFCI, since we are using bootstrap for 100 times, we will have 100 Grasp-Fci result, which is all the casual realtionships within the graph. 
The code of importing the data into R, and then writing the code to automated all the results.
